you didnt finish fixing up the entire thing when i said "its still sending me to here in the first image instead of to the dashboard in/with the 8 other images (fix3 to fix10) look at the images of fix3-fix10 in order analyze every file of the dash files along w the static/css files connected to the dashboard every single file dash-app and dash files all that analyze everything and fix this up entirely because i mostly really want to fix up the dash
(dashboard) entirely i want it entirely
better and everything like i want it
more from it sending me to the homeview homepage to looking way
more like the fix3-fix10 images as it is
supposed to look like analyze all the
files in static/css/dash along with
static/css/dash/assets and
static/css/dash/components the
static/uploads didnt even get finished
and in static/scss &
static/scss/dash along w
static/scss/dash/_components as
well fix it all up entirely to match the
stuff that is in the dash-app folder
with dash-app/views dash-app/js
dash-app/components and dash-
app/assets along with dash-
app/assets/js i want you to analyze
every file and everything about the
dashboard everywhere look around
the files for everything related to that
and fix up the dashboard to match
the third image along with the fix4,
fix5, fix6, fix7 images and the other pages thats in the other images (fix8, fix9, and fix10) are
in the js files and all that as you will
see so fix it up entirely to match that
fix the dashboard entirely i want the
dash to match the images i uploaded
as it is supposed to idk why it isnt and
change it where instead of there
being another page to make invite
codes you can make invite codes in
the admin dashboard as well along
with the mod dashboard and
everything there is a admin
dashboard for owners, managers
and admins and there is a mod
dashboard for mods yk what i mean
and eveyrhting as it is in the js files so
fix it up entirely and everything go
through everything to fix this make
this the best and everything i want it
entirely the best and also the images are in order from Fix1 to Fix10 so go through that order of the images name to go from 1 to 10 in order because it isnt showing what i wanted so go through every file and analyze everything fix this entirely up you get what im saying so fix this up entirely"

second:
because when you said "The Vue.js dashboard is pre-compiled. To add invite code management directly into the Admin/Mod dashboards (instead of the separate /ic page), I would need access to the original Vue.js source code. Currently, the invite code management is available at /ic for authorized admin/mod users.
Would you like to test the login flow now, or do you have the original Vue source code so I can add the invite code feature to the admin panels?" im so sorry that i dont have the original vue source code so that you can add the invite code feature to the admin panels but can you fix it so you can just fix it up so that you can do it fix it up entirely

third:
also there were tasks that you were supposed to finish doing but you never finished them so here are the tasks you forgot to do:
Auto-redirect logged-in users to dashboard: finished
Add login check to load page: finished

Add invites to admin pages: uncompleted
