**What is Glowi.es?**
Glowi.es is a fast, reliable, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) file hosting service. Files are encrypted *client-side* before upload, stored securely, and delivered through simple randomized URLs. Upload files up to **200 MB** permanently (unless deleted).

---

**Who created Glowi.es?**
Glowi.es is developed and maintained by the Glowi.es team—focused on privacy, performance, and creating the cleanest E2EE hosting experience on the internet.

---

**What kinds of files are allowed?**
Most normal file types are accepted. However, the following file types are **not allowed** for security reasons:

* `.exe`
* `.scr`
* `.cpl`
* `.doc*`
* `.jar`

These will be rejected automatically.

---

**How do I upload files?**
You may upload files in one of two ways:

* **File Upload:** Select files or drag-and-drop them into the upload area.
* **URL Upload:** Paste a direct link into the “Upload via URL” field.

After uploading, you will receive a permanent, encrypted link such as:
`https://glowi.es/files/######.fileextension`
(`######` = random 6-character alphanumeric ID)

---

**What is the maximum upload size?**
Glowi.es supports uploads up to **200 MB**.

---

**How long are files stored?**
Glowi.es permanent hosting stores files indefinitely unless you delete them from your account or they violate our Terms of Service.

---

**Are files encrypted?**
Yes. All files are encrypted **before they leave your device** using E2EE.
Even we cannot view your uploaded files.

---

**Can files be removed?**
Yes. You may delete your files at any time through the dashboard. Files violating the ToS may also be removed by administrators.

---

**Can Glowi.es be used via apps or tools?**
Yes. You may integrate Glowi.es into scripts, uploaders, or third-party tools using standard POST uploads. (Public API documentation is coming soon.)

---

**Are files scanned or analyzed?**
No. Because of E2EE, Glowi.es cannot view or analyze the contents of uploaded files.

---

**Why did my file upload fail?**
Common reasons:

* File exceeded the 200 MB limit
* Forbidden file type
* Upload server timeout
* Corrupted source file
* Remote URL didn’t return a valid file

**How does Glowi.es generate random file names?**
Every uploaded file is assigned a randomized **6-character alphanumeric string** to create unique links (e.g., `https://glowi.es/files/xA92fB.png`).

---

**Is there a dark mode?**
Yes—toggle **Go Dark?** at the bottom of the page to switch themes.
