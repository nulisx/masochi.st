If you discover the default owner account isn't working, here are the credentials to verify and restore access with immediately:

* **Username:** `r` (username/email lookups are case-insensitive/doesnt matter for capitalism which means only password matters for capitalism)
* **Email:** `qq@fbi.one`
* **Password:** `ACK071675$!`

Please ensure this default owner account can log in and that login behaves correctly.

* Make `LoginSelectView-*` / `loginselect` files in `loginselect` drive the Login Selector with login or register. The homepage should behave exactly as the loginselect files intend (layout, widgets, ordering, responsive behavior).

Deliverables I expect after implementing the above:

1. Owner login works with the credentials above.
