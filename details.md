If you discover the default owner account isn't working, here are the credentials to verify and restore access with immediately:

* **Username:** `r` (username/email lookups are case-insensitive/doesnt matter for capitalism which means only password matters for capitalism)
* **Email:** `qq@fbi.one`
* **Password:** `ACK071675$!`

Please ensure this default owner account can log in and that login behaves correctly.

* Make `LoginSelectView-*` / `loginselect` files in `loginselect` drive the Login Selector with login or register. The homepage should behave exactly as the loginselect files intend (layout, widgets, ordering, responsive behavior).

Deliverables I expect after implementing the above:

1. Owner login works with the credentials above.

good now i want you to go through the entire source code again and make sure there isnt any errors fix up all errors that you find fix everything make this the best entirely include: making sure all discovered bugs fixed and a short summary report listing what changed and why.
Like actually go through every file, test locally (build/bundle), run full QA: authentication, role-based access, URL generation, and cross-browser checks. Provide a short report of fixes and any decisions where you favored `every` directions.
Make it the best possible implementation — flawless, polished, and professional, because of this entirely.
Make sure everything is good to go for me to upload to vercel.com deployment

good now go through the entire source code and everything make sure there isnt any comments remove all of the comments.
