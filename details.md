If you discover the default owner account isn't working, here are the credentials to verify and restore access with immediately:

* **Username:** `r` (username/email lookups are case-insensitive/doesnt matter for capitalism which means only password matters for capitalism)
* **Email:** `qq@fbi.one`
* **Password:** `ACK071675$!`

Please ensure this default owner account can log in and that login behaves correctly.

Deliverables I expect after implementing the above:

1. Owner login works with the credentials above.

* Make `LoginSelectView-*` / `loginselect` files in `loginselect` drive the Login Selector with login or register. The homepage should behave exactly as the loginselect files intend (layout, widgets, ordering, responsive behavior).

### loginselect — files to use as source of truth (apply changes across these files)

LoginSelectView-CFUMygy4.js
LoginSelectView-D9EZ9g1N.css

great now look at the first image i messed up the thing i accidentally made my default owner as a user in the dash fix it also with this i want you to update the recovery thing so instead of it just doing this in the 2nd image (should be purple instead of green anyways) it would instead have a thing in the Dash Overview page also change it in the Dash overview page from saying Dashboard on the sidebar to saying Overview and look at the 3rd image i want you to make it have that in the Overview page in the dash yk what i mean like finish setting it up in the Overview page and add it above the Latest Updates thing because Latest Updates will be below it instead yk

and along with all of this i want you to also add Web Analytics and Speed Insights for vercel deployment yk what i mean like built in somewhere yk:
