what happened to the dash it looks nothing like the image i have uploaded aka the izZ9i.png file i want it to entirely look the image fix it up entirely but make it purple instead of blue make it exactly like the image change it from the search bar being CMD K (CMD+K) to being Alt K (Alt+K) yk what i mean fix that as well like it can still have that icon K thing but it would be used like Alt+K instead of Cmd+K to be used yk what i mean so fix this entirely up to look like the image ive provied and what happened to the admin+mod panel where theres an admin page and everything and look at the second image theres errors with the E2EE file hosting fix tha tup as well fix this all up fix up every error
errors are in the pasted text fix up everything entirely this is bad it isnt even working properly everything is messed up you messed it all up fix it all upe ntirely i want everything to be great like how i want it not worse than what it was so fix it up what happened to the old dash i just wanted you to update it a bit not do all of this so fix it up entirely because when i said what i said above i didnt mean all of this
there were also tasks that you were supposed to finished:
In progress tasks 3 / 4:
Add missing file details for uploads: finished
Change search shortcut to Alt+K: finished
Add admin panel with user roles: finished
Check all fixes work properly: uncompleted
while you were doing this above theres other errors as why it keeps sending me to "Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/runner/workspace/profile/index.html'" when i go to my page on @r or to why it says "Failed to upload avatar" when i try to upload a new avatar like so in this third image also fix it where usernames can be changed just that it wont work if there is already a user with the current username yk what i mean
now look at the 4th and 5th image to how the connections should be and how it would work so fix that i mean its good how it is now i was just saying add more connections like fix that part is what i meant
now finnaly with the 6th image i want you to fix it where instead of the 7th image mostly which the dash homepage now is supposed to be for the Security page instead so fix it where its most more like the 6th image instead of the 7th image and how it works in the 6th image is that UID is for the number of when u registered like if ur the 3rd person that registered there isnt a default number that says 3176 for Storage Used same thing its for the e2ee file hosting tho for how much gb u used of it and for the license status thats for when someone thats an admin or mod or manager or owner sets u as a premium member for the file hosting you get what im saying and for latest updates its to put updates that automatically got updated like things on the site that got updated with the date when it got updated ima show u an example because its most likely like the 8th, 9th and 10th images and thats how its used and finally for the shoutbox thats just notifications on stuff which was replaced with the buttons at the top next to the username with the avatar image the email icon for email notifications button for when the user is receiving updates about their account updations and other stuff and for the regular notifications button thats just for the Latest Updates notifications about the website yk what i mean
as for every image thats uploaded of 1 to about 26 images so fix this entirely up okay capeesh? good now update this all entirely up fix it up entirely make it make the image fix the css and everything i want this to be the best ever made
