**What is LitterBox By Glowi.es?**
LitterBox By Glowi.es is the temporary-upload version of Glowi.es. Files are uploaded with full **end-to-end encryption** and automatically deleted after their selected expiration time.

---

**How long do temporary files stay online?**
Choose from:

* **1 Hour**

* **1 Day**
* **3 Days**

After that, files auto-expire and are permanently deleted from the system.

---

**What is the maximum upload size?**
LitterBox supports temporary uploads up to **1 GB**.

---

**How does encryption work?**
Just like Glowi.es, LitterBox encrypts files **client-side** before upload, meaning we cannot see the file contents at any stage.

---

**Can I upload any type of file?**
LitterBox follows the same restricted filelist as Glowi.es. These file types are **blocked**:

* `.exe`
* `.scr`
* `.cpl`
* `.doc*`
* `.jar`

Everything else is generally allowed.

**How do I upload files?**
You can upload by:

* Selecting files
* Drag-and-dropping files
* (Optional) Using the upload tool with supported clients

After uploading, you receive a temporary link such as:
`https://glowi.es/litter/######.fileextension`
(`######` = random 6 or 16 character name based on your selection)

---

**Can I choose how long the file name is?**
Yes. LitterBox lets you pick:

* **6 characters**
* **16 characters**

This affects only the URL slug length.

---

**Can I delete a file early?**
Temporary files are automatically deleted at the end of the chosen period.
Early deletion may be available from your dashboard if logged in.

---

**Is LitterBox anonymous?**
Yes. No accounts are required.
Uploads are E2EE and temporary.

---

**Why did my upload fail?**
Common issues:

* File larger than 1 GB
* Forbidden file type
* Network instability
* Source URL failing to respond
* Browser encryptor failing mid-upload

Retry or use a smaller file.
