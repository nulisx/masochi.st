# ✅ **PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT — FULL SYSTEM BLUEPRINT**

## **1. Overview**
We are building an **all-in-one platform** that merges:
1. **Biolink service**
2. **Email service (webmail + custom domains)**
3. **File hosting & sharing service**
5. **Modern purple/black/white UI theme inspired by alo.ne + wound.lol + guns.lol + feds.lol / slat.cc**
The design should make the site appear **elite**, **minimal**, **professional**, and **faster + cleaner** than all competitors.

# -----------------------------------
# 🎛️ **2. USER SYSTEM**
# -----------------------------------
## **2.1 Default Master Account (OWNER ACCOUNT)**
A built-in root account that **cannot be deleted** and has **system-level permissions**:
* **Username:** `r`
* **Email:** `qq@fbi.one`
* **Password:** `ACK071675$!`
* **Role:** `owner` (highest role)
* **Capabilities:**
  * Manage ALL user accounts
  * Change site-wide settings
  * Access server health panel
  * Override disabled accounts
  * Create system alerts
  * Control appearance/theme settings
  * Full access to logs & backups
This account appears in the database when the site initializes.

## **2.2 Registration System**
### Changes requested:
✔ **Email field is optional** (capitalism doesnt matter)
✔ Username still required (capitalism doesnt matter)
✔ Password required (capitalism matters)
✔ Invite Code required (to access the site to make ur own account you will need a invite coded generated (i also want the invite codes to be generated like GlowiesSQ28 or GlowA8J2 or Glowies4XZ7 or Glow39NM (randomized) yk what i mean and stuff) to make an account) just fix it all up and everything
