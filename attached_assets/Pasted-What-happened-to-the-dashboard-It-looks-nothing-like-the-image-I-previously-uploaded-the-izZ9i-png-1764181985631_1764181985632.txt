What happened to the dashboard? It looks nothing like the image I previously uploaded (the izZ9i.png file). I need the dashboard to look **exactly** like that image (izZ9i.png)—same structure, same layout—just with a purple theme instead of blue. Please fix the entire dashboard UI so it fully matches the reference design.

Also, the search bar shortcut needs to be updated. Change it from CMD+K (⌘K) to Ctrl+K (Ctrl+K). Keep the same “⌘” icon, but the activation key must be Ctrl+K instead of Cmd+K/⌘+K.

Next, the Admin + Mod panels are missing or broken. The admin page and moderation pages must be fully restored and fully functional. In the second image I sent, there are errors related to E2EE file hosting—those need to be fixed as well. The current implementation is broken; many parts of the system aren’t even working properly. Everything became messed up, and I need the whole system fixed and restored to a high-quality working state. I wanted the old dashboard updated slightly, not replaced with something worse. Please repair everything so it functions and looks exactly how I want it.

Additionally, fix the username system so users can change their username, but only if the new username is not already taken by another user.

In the Connections page, users should be able to **edit** their existing connections instead of being forced to disconnect and reconnect with new details. Please implement full editing functionality.

Now, regarding the 3rd (dash1.png) and 4th (dash2.png) images:
The page that currently looks like the 4th image (dash2.png) must be redesigned to look and behave like the 3rd image (dash1.png) instead. The “dashboard homepage” should actually be the **Security** page. In the 3rd image (dash1.png), the UID represents the registration order (for example, if a user is the 3rd person to ever register, their UID should be 3). Storage Used should show the actual amount of E2EE file hosting storage the user has consumed—do not show a fake default number like 3176. The License Status should reflect whether an admin/mod/manager/owner sets a user as a Premium member for file hosting.

For Latest Updates, the system needs to automatically generate update entries showing what recently changed on the site, each with the correct date. This should work similar to the examples shown in the 5th, 6th, and 7th images.

The Shoutbox from the old design has been replaced by the buttons next to the username at the top right. The email icon is for email-based notifications about account updates and related information. The regular notification icon is for Latest Updates notifications about new website changes. Make sure this entire behavior is implemented correctly.

Finally, I have also uploaded a folder named **fixfiles**. Please analyze every file entirely in that folder and use them to restore and correctly rebuild the mod panel, admin panel, security system, download/file-hosting system, file viewer, bio settings, and all other dashboard components. Go through all of the files in the fixfiles folder and apply everything necessary to rebuild this system perfectly.

I want this dashboard and service to be not just good—but the **best** and **greatest** biolink service and along with a E2EE file-hosting service dashboard ever created. Fix everything fully, accurately, and professionally. Make it look exactly like the images and function flawlessly. This needs to be the greatest version of the dashboard imaginable.
