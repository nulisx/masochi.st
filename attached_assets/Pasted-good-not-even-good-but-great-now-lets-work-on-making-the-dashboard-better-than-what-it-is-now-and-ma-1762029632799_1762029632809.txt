good not even good but great now lets work on making the dashboard better than what it is now and make a default account for the main owner of the site aka me the username will be set as r and the password set as ACK071675$! (also fix up the register its 1-12 characters now and the Username and Password should have a red X by it if u dont meet requirements of what to put then it turns into a green checkmark when you do and fix the part where it says At least 8 characters it should say something like this:
Your password must contain:
At least 8-12 characters (goes from the normal text color to a purple or a color matching the image i sent earlier that wasnt gonna be the logo but color details of it yk what i mean)
At least 1 uppercase letter (goes from the normal text color to a purple or a color matching the image i sent earlier that wasnt gonna be the logo but color details of it yk what i mean)
At least 1 lowercase letter (goes from the normal text color to a purple or a color matching the image i sent earlier that wasnt gonna be the logo but color details of it yk what i mean)
At least 1 digit (goes from the normal text color to a purple or a color matching the image i sent earlier that wasnt gonna be the logo but color details of it yk what i mean)
At least 1 special character (goes from the normal text color to a purple or a color matching the image i sent earlier that wasnt gonna be the logo but color details of it yk what i mean))

now that were done with those details lets work on the dashboard look at these images for examples on how the dashboard should be and even better than (the images are named to give you more organization of how it should be incase they get sent to you in a wrong order you know like you look at the images and if they are in order the names of the images could help you get them in order organizated the right way you get what i mean) since i can only upload 20 images i will wait till ur done w this part of the dashboard then i will upload the last/rest of the 17 other images to finish this up entirely okay?
