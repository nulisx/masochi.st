basically i want to fix up the css like just make it darker, reduce all the purple change up the css entirely Well, a simple change I always like to do is making fonts and all of the buttons like smaller and thinner. Gives it more space around the outer edges of the page so it just looks cleaner, in my eyes at least Almost like using 90% zoom instead of the default 100% zoom on a website but it's just the website elements being smaller Makes the fonts look soooo much better imo (in my opinion) Yeah so instead of it being big as shit like the first image, everything is smaller and puts more space around the edges of the page so it feels cleaner to look at but not exactly like these images but as an example yk change up the font as well like depends what style i really want
look at shock.lol as an example
and some of their biolinks
like /x (https://shock.lol/x) and /-1 (https://shock.lol/-1) because I actually kinda like the font, I'd probably either change or just remove the icons slanting when you hover over the boxes though, since the boxes already kinda move on the hover, both moving looks weird and fix and it on the hover bar above where the sign up button is add another button so it could be Login / Register not like saying Login Register but saying Login / Register yk yes we will be changing it from saying Sign Up or Sign In to Register i want the css to be even better like entirely better than what it is like take examples off these websites: https://feds.lol/, https://www.hyperstudio.org/, https://blok.so/, https://playlist.studio/, and https://onmi.io/
the website https://playlist.studio/
like this inspires me the most but because ion want it to look basic like every biolink nor look like it was used by AI bc everyone says it looks AI when it isnt i want it to be like unique not similar to every biolink service because its Honestly just waaaaaaay too much purple, the colorscheme can work but I'd replace some of the purple with like a darker color or just black all together, so the purple stands out more rather than taking literally the entire website over like try making a biolink in the style of playlist.studio just make it entirely the best yk what im saying like i want to keep the same size as stuff i have alreayd just change up the styling a bit like same sizes as borders n shit yk
