like fully really analyze the izZ9i.png image analyze it entirely find every spec and everything every aspect of it get the right icons like w the shield icon looking like the WebRTC Leak Shield icon like in the second image and the Privacy Settings icon looking like a eye and the data protection icon looking like a shield w a lock on the bottom right of it while the login history is like a clock rotating clockwise or wtv and the account recovery is like a key yk what i mean fix it entirely up also make it where the API part in the dash has the purple border dash around it but its grey instead like in the izZ9i.png image as it is on the bottom also with the text glowi.es next to the image in the dash top left make the text size the same size as sexi.st is in the izZ9i.png image also fix the Security tab in the dash to actually look entirely like the sexi.st izZ9i.png image entirely yk what i mean make it where when you click the enable or disable button for the two-factor authentication it takes you to the Settings tab along with Password when you click the change button it takes you to the security tab as well instead of opening a Change Password box and it is only there in the Security tab to tell you a realtime sync when the password was changed make everything not mock data make everything be realtime sync entirely make this have realtime and realtime sync all that and look at the third image which is a image of the izZ9i.png image of the Terms of Service i want you to change the TOS icon in the dash to be similar to that now look at the 3rd image which is also a image of the izZ9i.png image i want you to make it where i have the ˅ thing where when you click on it the symbol then goes to ^ when its opened but when you click on it or if its closed its back to ˅ and when it opens it displays/popups whether to go to either of the tabs: Profile
Settings
or Logout of the account yk what i mean dont forget to make the Security tab look exactly and entirely like the izZ9i.png image analyze the izZ9i.png image entirely to do so
