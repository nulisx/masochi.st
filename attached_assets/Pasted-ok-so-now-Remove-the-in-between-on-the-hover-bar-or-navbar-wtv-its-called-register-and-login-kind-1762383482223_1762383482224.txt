ok so now Remove the / in between on the hover bar or navbar wtv its called register and login, kinda unneeded maybe change it to just Login
The rest looks way better
Just up to your personal preference now I think but most people will like this much more I bet
make the css a little more better and advanced also fix the icons with the stuff below like fix the icons back with the images in static folder w cdn folder and avatars folder also the assets folder fix all the images and icons to be correctly
fix icons stuff:

and then make the site totally better more advanced with the css including the entire site with login register and all that and make the     <div class="hero-container">
        <div class="meow">:sparkles: Premium Bio Links</div> entirely better than what it is now as well i want that better too make the navbar something like this image that goes on login and register as well like it does for elyria.cc but instead of the navbar being on the bottom on elyria.cc its on the top like ours is already yk what im saying add a about folder w index.html in it same for pricing and privacy make it similar to elyria.cc/about and elyria.cc/pricing and elyria.cc/privacy entirely but with my css now and everything make it entirely the best i want it to be the most unique ever css ever seen before
